A fork of the Anki-Android app on 2/7/19. I will not attempt to keep this version in sync with the main version going forward. 

You probably want https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android

What I am doing here fow now is 1) renaming the App (creatively, "FletcherAnki") so it can run along side the original and 2) changing the scheduler for my own usage since I do not like the way Anki currently does learning steps. I will probably do other experimental things which will be incompatible with the original.
